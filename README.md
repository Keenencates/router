Routers Project

The Router Project aims to help organizations by increasing the effeciency of volunteer transportation. At the Non-profit we worked with, drivers had problems with overlapping routes. This project aims to reduce route overlap by clustering the students by vehicles as best as possible.

This page is under construction as I need to do a post-mortem with different groups to find at what is acceptable for me to do with this project, post-mortem.

FUTURE
--------
I think our group had a missed oppurtunity for machine learning, and after taking a few machine learning courses -- I believe I can make this project better via machine learning.
